# Criterion A: Planning
## Problem Definition
My client is the owner of a local bank wher he manages personal. In the past the employees
of the bank have experience pishing and other cybertreats that compromised the information 
and finances of the bank. The main concern of my client at the monent is the multiple 
passwords that employees have to use for the multiple software applications that the bank 
has. employees have resorted to write down passwords on paper, google docs or even
postit notes which are visible to all employees. 
My client is concern about these practices (**See the evidence of Consulation in the Appendix**).

## Proposed Solution

## Success Criteria
1. The solution will be able to display clear, accurate graphs depicting **temperature** and **humidity** trends in residential homes over a duration of **48 hours**. 
2. The indoor environment variables will be successfully measured with a **DHT11 sensor** connected to a **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B**. 
3. If the user enters the secret code ("open123"), the program will change modes and act as a password manager.
4. Data read by the DHT11 sensor will be:
   * **Stored Locally** in a CSV file for easy access and backup.
   * **Uploaded to a Local Server** in real time to ensure data redundancy and avoid data loss during power outages.
5. A detailed **poster** will be prepared to summarize the project findings. This shall include:
   * Graphical representation of temperature and humidity trends
   * Key observations from mathematical modeling and comparative analysis
   * Practical recommendations on enhancing energy efficiency
