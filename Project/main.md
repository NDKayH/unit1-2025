# Criterion A: Planning
## Problem Definition
My client is the owner of a local bank wher he manages personal. In the past the employees
of the bank have experience pishing and other cybertreats that compromised the information 
and finances of the bank. The main concern of my client at the monent is the multiple 
passwords that employees have to use for the multiple software applications that the bank 
has. employees have resorted to write down passwords on paper, google docs or even
postit notes which are visible to all employees. 
My client is concern about these practices (**See the evidence of Consulation in the Appendix**).

## Proposed Solution

## Success Criteria
1. The calculator should accept user input to perform basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
1. The calculator can handle typical errors (e.g., division by zero) and give appropriate feedback.
1. If the user enters the secret code ("open123"), the program will change modes and act as a password manager.
1. In password manager mode, the user should be able to perform CRUD operations (Create, Replace, Update, Delete):
   * Add a password (for example, for a website).
   * View the stored passwords (only if they re-enter the secret code).
1. Save passwords permanently and securely
1. Use the terminal to interact with the user.
